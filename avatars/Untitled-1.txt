When jumping up, you should not be able to press forward

jumping should have a cooldown, especially after a longer jumptime

after jumping you cannot sprint straight away 


handle default if no state animation

blender tool to allow adjustments


editor tool for animations
-allow ability to spread arms in poses ( like idle needs the arms to be more spread ) (overdrive? cant recall name)


Let the jump animation end..

@textametron#2606 the jump forward needs 2 varieties, one with each leg kicking forward first. 
can you please make a jump forward animation (Same as jump_forward_2.fbx) 
but with the other foot leading the jump, there may be some mirror option youve seen in blender? Mirror option should usually work in mixamo, 
but those animations are not playable with our system (some bug).
